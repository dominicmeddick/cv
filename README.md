I am a South African living in London. I've been up to a fair amount in my short time in London trying to find my feet. And I've found them! They are directly below my ankles and finally facing in the direction I've been wanting to go for some time now. Software developing has always been something I've been interested in throughout the years but always thought I'd need a Computer Science degree to pursue it. Then I learnt about Makers and here I am! I've finished the bootcamp and am now applying for roles with the hopes of becoming a junior developer. 

**Personal Profile**

- I've always been most productive in a team. I enjoy bouncing ideas off of people, problem solving and am adaptable. 
- I'm able to keep a level head and continue to problem solve in high pressure situations. 
- I am a creative thinker and am able to make decisions when others are reluctent to. 
- I am never satisfied with what I know and always want to expand my knowledge and skill set. 
- I am inherently curious about the world and I intend to keep it that way!

**Projects**

This project shows my understanding of Object Oriented concepts. It's my biggest project post Makers and I am very happy with how the backend has shaped up. 

Final Project: https://github.com/dominicmeddick/pace-1

Originally inspired by the idea of bringing people together via their common interests, namely exercise, we stretched the idea further to address the social issue of women's safety when running. The app is inclusive of all people, but offers a medium through which people can meet up safely and securely. Where they can find a partner to hold them accountable to their fitness goals and provide them with safety along the way.

**Work Experience**

**Presteigne Broadcast Hire (October 2019 – March 2021)**
Audio Technician

I worked in a team to build bespoke audio and communications systems for broadcast TV. Clients would give us requirements which were unique for each job and from there we had to break down the product to complete the puzzle. The job required problem solving, trail and error and working with all the departments in the company.

University of Cape Town, South Africa (January 2015 – December 2018)

**Hobbies**

Playing guitar - I really enjoy songwriting. I've been playing guitar since I was 10 years old.

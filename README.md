Dominic Meddick

I am a South African living in London. I've been up to a fair amount in my short time in London trying to find my feet. And I've found them! They are directly below my ankles and finally facing in the direction I've been wanting to go for some time now. Software developing has always been something I've been interested in throughout the years but always thought I'd need a Computer Science degree to pursue it. Then I learnt about Makers and here I am! I've finished the bootcamp and am now applying for roles with the hopes of becoming a junior developer. 

**Personal Profile**

I've always been most productive in a team. I enjoy bouncing ideas off of people, problem solving and am adaptable. I'm able to keep a level head and continue to problem solve in high pressure situations. I am a creative thinker and am able to make decisions when others are reluctent to. I am never satisfied with what I know and always want to expand my knowledge and skill set. I am inherently curious about the world and I intend to keep it that way!

**Work Experience**

**Presteigne Broadcast Hire (October 2019 – March 2021)**
Audio Technician

I worked in a team to build bespoke audio and communications systems for broadcast TV. Clients would give us requirements which were unique for each job and from there we had to break down the product to complete the puzzle. The job required problem solving, trail and error and working with all the departments in the company. 

**Freelance (January 2019 - September 2019)**

When I first got to London I was pretty much doing a new thing every week! I worked in a carpet store called 'Simply Floors' part time. I mainly did administration and helped cut carpet to size to go out to clients. Towards the end I started going out on jobs too! I worked in a few recording studios around London. I spent the most time at Brixton Recording Studios. I worked on a film set for a week at 'Light As Air' working as an apprentice for the electrical team. I worked for the New Moon in Putney as a freelance live sound engineer. The last thing worth a mention is EK Crew where I worked with florists for weddings and flower competitions like the Chelsea Flower Show Competition.

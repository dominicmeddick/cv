Dominic Meddick

I am a South African living in London. I've been up to a fair amount in my short time in London trying to find my feet. And I've found them! They are directly below my ankles and finally facing in the direction I've been wanting to go for some time now. Software developing has always been something I've flirted with over the years but always thought I'd need a Computer Science degree to pursue it. Then I learnt about Makers and here I am! Studying with the hopes of becoming a junior developer. 

**Presteigne Broadcast Hire (October 2019 – March 2021)**
Audio Technician

I worked in a team to build bespoke audio and communications systems for broadcast TV. We were told what the systems needed to do and from there we had to choose the right pieces of equipment to complete the puzzle. The main part of every job was problem solving, trail and error and working with all the departments in the company to get the jobs prepped and ready to go. 

**Freelance (January 2019 - September 2019)**

When I first got to London I was pretty much doing a new thing every week! I worked in a carpet store called 'Simply Floors' part time. I mainly did administration and helped cut carpet to size to go out to clients. Towards the end I started going out on jobs too! I worked in a few recording studios around London. I spent the most time at Brixton Recording Studios. I worked on a film set for a week at 'Light As Air' working as an apprentice for the electrical team. I worked for the New Moon in Putney as a freelance live sound engineer. The last thing worth a mention is EK Crew where I worked with florists for weddings and flower competitions like the Chelsea Flower Show Competition. 

**Skills**

Teamwork

I've always been the most productive in a team. I enjoy bouncing ideas off of people, problem solving and am adaptable. I've been playing music with other musicians for as long as I can remember and created some things I'm very proud of along the way. Here is a project I co-founded with a student while I was in university:

Problem Solving

I'm able to keep a level head and continue to problem solve in high pressure situations. I am a creative thinker and am able to make decisions when others are reluctent to. 

Curiousity 

I am never satisfied with what I know and always want to expand my knowledge and skill set. I am inherently curious about the world and I intend to keep it that way! My hobbies section is hopefully an indicated of this. 

**Education**

Makers Academy (March 2021 - June 2021)

I've only just started this new adventure but so far I've completed the precouse and have (what I imagine) is a basic understanding of programming in Ruby, github, the command line, pair programming and Rspec.

University of Cape Town, South Africa (January 2015 – December 2018)

Bachelor of Music Majoring in Music Technology

Majors: Music Technology IV, Music Theory and Analysis IV, History of Western Music IV

**Hobbies **

I like playing and writing music. Here's a song, but beware! This link contains music written by me (my lovely girlfriend on vocals): https://open.spotify.com/track/7AW1lofFaoB6pjIul4ad2b?si=tYA5_4mqSdqRCJimKGM3dw

I enjoy the outdoors. Hiking, camping, fishing. And exercise. I'm a regular gym goer and am partial to a bit of boxing and karate (Kimura Shukokai). 

I'm interested in the stock market and have a dividend based portfolio which I'd like to use to pay for my Netflix subscription but I still have a way to go. 

I like cooking, I sometimes cook healthy and sometimes cook Italian. Still trying to find that balance. 

Video games are fun! But not by myself. I only play co-op games and basic ones at that. Sea of theives, Battlefield, COD, Rogue company. 

I'm a collector of whisky. I hope to expand it past the Isle of Islay one day but today is not that day.

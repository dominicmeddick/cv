**About Me** üë®üèª‚Äçüíªüé∏

I‚Äôve been combining my interests in music and software development ever since I was young, even pursuing a Music Technology degree at university. Writing music and writing code both, in their own ways, feel like solving a satisfying puzzle. 

In my first career as an audio technician for live broadcasts, I enjoyed the high impact and collaborative environment that came with building and developing bespoke systems. However, in the past year I started itching for a new challenge and the opportunity to do more engineering work. Following the Makers Academy course, I‚Äôm now on the hunt for my first role as a Full Stack Software Developer!

**Work Experience**

**Presteigne Broadcast Hire (October 2019 ‚Äì March 2021)**

#### Audio Technician

- I worked in a team to build bespoke audio and communications systems for broadcast TV. 
- Clients would give us requirements which were unique for each job and from there we had to break down the product to complete the puzzle. This improved my ability to work under pressure as we had very strict deadlines and often a limited time to complete the projects.
- The job required problem solving, trail and error and working with all the departments in the company. 

**Education**

- Makers Academy (March 2021 - June 2021)

- University of Cape Town, South Africa (January 2015 ‚Äì December 2018)   
  - Bachelor of Music Majoring in Music Technology Majors:
  - History of Western Music IV, Music Technology IV, Music Theory and Analysis IV

**Hobbies**

- Playing guitar: I really enjoy songwriting. I've been playing guitar since I was 10 years old. 

- Exercise: I enjoy weight training, HIIT and boxing. 

- Cooking: Learning how to cook Italian food the right way has been a passion of mine over the last few years. 

- Outdoors: I am an avid hiker. I hiked for 2 weeks across the Cederberg mountain range during my schooling years and have loved it ever since.

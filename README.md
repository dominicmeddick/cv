- I enjoy bouncing ideas off of people, problem solving and am adaptable. 
- I'm able to keep a level head and continue to problem solve in high pressure situations. 
- I am a creative thinker and am able to make decisions when others are reluctent to. 
- I am never satisfied with what I know and always want to expand my knowledge and skill set. 
- I am inherently curious about the world and I intend to keep it that way!

**Projects**

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
|[Card Game](https://github.com/dominicmeddick/pixie_tech_test)| A very simple card game, played between two or more players where immediately after the cards are dealt, the player with the highest hand wins. | Ruby, HTML, Heroku |
|[Pace](https://github.com/dominicmeddick/pace-1) | Originally inspired by the idea of bringing people together via their common interests, namely exercise, we stretched the idea further to address the social issue of women's safety when running. The app is inclusive of all people, but offers a medium through which people can meet up safely and securely. Where they can find a partner to hold them accountable to their fitness goals and provide them with safety along the way. | Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Javascript, Postgres, Google Maps API |
|[Find My Range](https://github.com/philsmithies/findmyrange) | The project I've just started working on. The idea is to transpose any song to best suit the users singing voice based off of their range. Really exciting to see where this goes! | Python, React Native, Javascript, AWS |
